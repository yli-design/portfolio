<h2>Artist</h2>
<!--   <p class="center">
      I am Yanrong Li. I am pursue a BFA degree in Digital Media Art at SJSU. Currently, most of my works are using Photoshop to create digital images, and using basic coding technology in my design. My works present my imagination, and things I fun interest in life, I express my thoughts and present them in the digital art form in fairy style, or abstract manner. <p>
<p class="center">
  Therefore, I apply these elements to my work in my Hyperreal Pandaâ€™s Residence series. And apply my imagination to create the dreamy story world to share with my audiences through visual and emotional effects. Besides, I also create some code art that I experience new ways to make art from traditional art tools.  I like to continue my panda series, as I exploring more technologies in DMA major, I want to build them in 3D form.
